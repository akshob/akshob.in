Hi, I'm Akshob! 👋

I'm an engineer with a passion for Linux infrastructure, networking, and automation. This blog documents my journey building and optimizing home lab environments, with a focus on practical solutions for real-world problems.

## What You'll Find Here

My articles cover hands-on technical guides for:

- **Linux Server Administration**: From headless Ubuntu setups to advanced system configuration
- **Network Infrastructure**: VPN deployments, network namespaces, and traffic isolation
- **Home Lab Optimization**: Multi-service environments with Pi-hole, Plex, HomeAssistant, and more
- **Infrastructure Consolidation**: How to safely run multiple services on a single machine
- **Automation & Security**: systemd services, proper user management, and security best practices

## My Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Documentation-driven development**: If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
- **Real-world testing**: All guides are battle-tested on production systems
- **Security by design**: Isolation and proper privilege management from day one
- **Simplicity over complexity**: Elegant solutions that are maintainable long-term

## Current Infrastructure

My current home lab runs on Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS and includes:
- Pi-hole for DNS filtering
- PiVPN with WireGuard for remote access
- Plex and Jellyfin for media streaming
- HomeAssistant and HomeBridge for home automation
- Isolated VPN namespaces for specific applications

Recently downsized from a two-machine setup to a single consolidated server using network namespace isolation—proving that smart architecture beats throwing more hardware at problems.

## Get in Touch

Found these guides helpful? Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to reach out or contribute to the discussions. All configuration examples and scripts shared here are from real deployments, so if something isn't working, let me know!

Happy hacking! 🚀
